**Primary Audience:** Times are wild. Canadian home prices are so out of control that anyone moving to  Canada would like to see the housing related data before making any life changing decision. 

**Objectives:** Canada’s openness to immigration is pitched as civic-minded global leadership. 
The National Housing Strategy Act (2019) declared that “the right to adequate housing is a fundamental human right affirmed in international law.” Adequate housing is understood as housing that provides secure tenure; is affordable; is habitable; provides access to basic infrastructure; is located close to employment, services and amenities; is accessible for people of all abilities; and is culturally appropriate.

This project focuses on the experience of recent immigrants living in Canada using the following indicators collected and produced by Statistics Canada. These are:  housing affordability, housing suitability, household expenditures, and show the extent of inequalities in housing.

**Plan (Visual and Predictive Analytics):** We have a tentative plan to do Analytics on Multiple-property owners status, Earning comparisons of owners, First time home buyers comparisons, Household expenditure trends province wise, Household expenditure comparison on products etc.
